Code Review 

* First thing I noticed regarding architecture for the project
that all members are scattered in different places. for example books module,
books feature module, models, services

* Being an angular application we could have use better 
architectural tree under one source. So all component, services, modules, stores can
be under one umbrella and have better manageable and clean code
